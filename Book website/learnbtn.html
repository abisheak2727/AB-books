    </center>

 <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a popular personal finance book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki. It shares lessons the author learned from two father figures: his own dad (referred to as “Poor Dad”), and his best friend’s father (referred to as “Rich Dad”). While Poor Dad was educated and worked in a stable job, Rich Dad was a businessman who understood how money works. The book compares the mindset of the two dads and teaches readers how to think and act like the rich.

    The main focus of the book is financial education. Kiyosaki believes that schools teach academic knowledge, but they don’t teach how to manage money. According to him, learning about money, investments, and assets is the key to financial success.

    <p>The book tells us that being rich is not just about having money. It's about having the right mindset and financial knowledge. Most people are taught to go to school, get a job, work hard, and depend on a paycheck. But this way of thinking can keep them stuck in what the author calls the rat race—a cycle of working, earning, spending, and never truly growing wealthy.

Rich Dad teaches that the key to becoming rich is to focus on buying assets—things that put money in your pocket. Examples include rental houses, stocks, businesses, or even writing a book that earns royalties. On the other hand, liabilities like expensive cars, phones, or loans take money out of your pocket.

The book also says we must learn to manage fear and greed. Fear of not having enough money makes people work harder for their jobs, while greed makes them spend more when they earn more. Rich Dad says, “Learn to control your emotions, and you'll control your money.”

Another big lesson is: Don’t work for money. Make money work for you. This means instead of trading time for money, invest your money wisely so it earns more by itself. People should learn about investing early and not wait until they are older.

The author also talks about the power of financial education. Most schools teach history and science, but not how to save, invest, or build wealth. That’s why many smart and hardworking people still struggle with money.

In the end, Rich Dad Poor Dad encourages readers to think differently, take smart risks, keep learning, and build wealth slowly and wisely. It’s not about becoming rich overnight—but about creating a better future through smart financial habits.
